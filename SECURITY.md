# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please email **security@cloudguard.local** (or open a private GitHub security advisory) with details. We aim to acknowledge within **48 hours**.

## Supported Versions
This is an MVP. We triage **main** branch only.

## Triage Process
1) We acknowledge receipt and assign a CVSS-like severity.
2) We reproduce the issue privately.
3) We prepare a fix and coordinated disclosure notes.
4) We publish a patched release and a public advisory.
